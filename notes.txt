--::: git push -u origin master :::--
The -u option to git push sets GitHub as the upstream repository, which means we’ll be able to download any changes automatically when we run git pull starting in Section 4.1. Don’t worry about these details, though; you will almost always copy such commands from GitHub and probably won’t ever have to figure them out on your own.

-::: adding files :::-
MH: "I suggest getting in the habit of running git add -A unless there’s a specific reason not to.""

-::: ignoring files :::-
Git lets us ignore such files using a special hidden configuration file called .gitignore.

-::: branching and merging :::-
One of the most powerful features of Git is its ability to make branches, which are effectively complete self-contained copies of the project source, together with the ability to merge one branch into another, thereby incorporating the changes into the original branch.


:: new branch ::
Our first step is to use git checkout with the -b option, which makes a new branch called about-page and checks it out at the same time
- git checkout -b about-page
